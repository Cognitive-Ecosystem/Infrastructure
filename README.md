We have made significant in-roads into understanding cognition as our methods have evolved from basic measures of sensorimotor skills with Francis Galton to more sophisticated neuropsychological batteries and neuroimaging, which provide the location of specialized mechanisms for specific mental processes. Smart technologies offer an opportunity to extend our knowledge one step further through real time streaming of data and next-generation means of inference of cognitive functioning through remote sensors. This Wiki serves as a portal connecting the tradition and future of cognitive assessments of aging and dementia, and provides evidence for informed decision-making. As such, it employs a smart infrastructure that covers four major areas, as shown in the table of contents to the right: (1) our current knowledge of core cognitive domains, (2) the scientific evidence showing how these domains are affected differently across various types of dementia, (3) the multitude of methods used to assess cognition from pencil and paper tests to smartphone apps on the market, (4) the applications of specific cognitive testing methods in research and clinical trials from academia and industry.

Collaboration is the engine of this system. It is therefore critical that we share our knowledge and solutions with each other through this platform. This collective and cooperative enterprise can provide meaningful insights, which could be the basis for higher intelligence in cognition.
